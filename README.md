# Urban_Transportation_Planning

Dr. Gregory Macfarlane's CE EN 565 course, [Urban Transportation Planning](https://byu-transpolab.github.io/ceen565/), contains assignments and labs where the reference code is written in R. Because I am Python's # 1 fan, I often rewrote my own code using Python instead of R. This repository contains a collection of this code.
